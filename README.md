# High Speed Running Distance Calculator
=======================================

## This project is to measure the high speed runnning distance (HSRD) of an athlete using gps data

### This repository includes 4 scripts:

###*packages.R* - this installs the required packages and must be executed first

###*distance_function.R* - this script contains the code for the HSRD caluclator - **it does not need to be executed**

###*HSRDcalculator.R* - this script once excuted applies the distance function on a gps file - it need **1 argument** - a gps file - which must be a **GPX file** - this script also creats a history of it's executions, saves it in a text file, in a data table format. it includes data of the training and the HSRD

###*result_analysis.R"* - Lastly this script is for analysis purposes, it's output is a pdf file containing a graph of the HSRD history

============================================================================

### Further work to be done on the analysis of the data include;

### A weekly representation of the HSRD

### Acute chronic load ratio calculations

### A comaprison of a rolling average ACLR and an exponentional weighted average model ACLR

============================================================================


### Work can also be done on comparing the accuarcy between garmin and a GPS pod such as STATSport

### It needs to be understood that gps pds are more acccuarte as take the gps location every 0.1 sec. 

### Where as garmin takes it every 1 sec. 

###**IMPORTANT** this needs to be configured sometimes garmins are configured to take the location once it "sees" movement, this will definitely lead to very  inaccurate results

### Due to the rapid direction nature of team sports and the rapid change of accelerations/deccelerations there will be inaccuarcies. By how much is the interesting bit.

### When training is on a bigger pitch it will yield more accuarate results, or when there is a lot of HSRD covered by an athlete
